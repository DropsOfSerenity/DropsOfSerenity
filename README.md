### Public and Private repositories no longer on Github.

I will not be hosting any of my non-work related github repositories
on github anymore due to [Github/Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/).

* Copilot uses your code to train machine learning algorithms without your explicit consent and despite any license on the code.
* My code is now hosted on a [self hosted Gitea server](https://git.legendarymune.com/DropsOfSerenity)
